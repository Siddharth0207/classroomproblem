Digitalyz Internship Problem Submission 


1st - Problem Session:
1. Confusion related to if i have to create json for each sheets in excel.
2. I will prioritize creating json for first "Student Request" will then create for all sheets.
3. I will use python for the entire process.
4. I will use pandas for data manipulation and json for data conversion.
5. there are fee missing values in "Student Request" will replace them with "null".
6. Data is not that big but i am considering the 1000 rows case and more as big data and will probably use Python Generators if possible. 


7. I am creating logger and exception file for debugging and ease of understanding.
8. I am creating function to read and create output json instead of writing same code for each sheet. I will pass sheet_location as input and get json data as output.
